## Using the bot
If you want to use Maxim, you have to

2. Build the gamemaster.
3. Get the `maxim_1-2.java` file in the "build" folder.
4. Change the `gamemasterName` variable (line 22) to the name of the file that you want Maxim to play in (with no changes to the gamemaster either "black" or "white"; standard is "black").

After this, Maxim will automatically begin to play the game as soon as he has any commands in the file specified above.
